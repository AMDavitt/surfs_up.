* Average temperature between June and December is 75 and 71 degrees respectively, show a moderate temperature and very little fluctuation between the two periods from an average standpoint.
* The average temperature for June was 75 degress, and 71 degrees for December. The data shows that there is very little seasonal variation
* The maximum temperature of for June was 85, and 83 for December. Again, demonstrating the steady temperatures
* The minimum temperature of 56 for December and 64 for June show the greatest difference. The low of 56 for December might be too low for surfing and ice cream meaning June's average temperature of 64 is a better time to open.
