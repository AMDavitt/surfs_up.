# Overview of the Surfs Up Challenge:
* The purpose of this challenge to review weather patterns in Hawaii in order to determine the best time to open a surf and ice cream shop. This project compared weather temperature in June and December, by looking at statstics for weather patterns in those two months we are able to make a proper recommendation.
# Results
* June Results

* December Results
![December Results](https://github.com/AMDavitt/surfs_up./blob/main/Screenshot%202022-05-29%20102555%20Dec.png)
* The average temperature for June was 75 degress, and 71 degrees for December. The data shows that there is very little seasonal variation
* The maximum temperature of for June was 85, and 83 for December. Again, demonstrating the steady temperatures
* The minimum temperature of 56 for December and 64 for June show the greatest difference. The low of 56 for December might be too low for surfing and ice cream meaning June's average temperature of 64 is a better time to open.
# Summary
* The weather in December and June are historically very similar, however the flucuations in December being wider than in June shows it's a worse time to open the surf and ice shop
* Additional queries using weather data include percipitation averages between June & December. Another useful weather metric to analyze would be to review the avergae temperatures for difference summer or winter months in order to decide if one might be superior to June or December.
