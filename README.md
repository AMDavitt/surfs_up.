# Overview of the Surfs Up Challenge:
* The purpose of this challenge to review weather patterns in Hawaii as we look to open a surf and ice cream shop. This project focused on the weather temperature in June and December, looking at different statistics between the two periods to help assess whether an ice cream/surf shop would have good weather conditions in which to operate.
